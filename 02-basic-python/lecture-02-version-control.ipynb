    "## Why version Control?\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Keep copies of multiple states of files**   \n",
    "  By committing you record a state of the file to which you can go back any time.\n",
    " * **Create alternative states**  \n",
    " Imagine you just want to try out something, but you realize you have to modify multiple files. You're not sure whether it works or is worth it. With version control you can just create a **branch** where you can experiment or develop new features without changing the main or other branches.\n",
    " * **Collaborate in teams**   \n",
    " Nobody wants to send code via e-mail or share via Dropbox. If two people work on a file at the same time it's unclear how to merge the code. Version control lets you keep your code in a shared central location and has dedicated ways to merge and deal with conflicts. \n",
    " * **Keep your work safe**  \n",
    " Your hard drive breaks. Your computer is stolen. But your code is safe because you store it not only on your computer but also on a remote server. \n",
    " * **Share**  \n",
    " You developed something awesome and want to share it. But not only do you want to make it available, you're also happy about contributions from others! \n",

    " * git – the stupid content tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "*I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'. -- Linus Torvalds*\n",
